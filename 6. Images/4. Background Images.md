# 4. Background Images

**`background-image`**
The **`background-image`** property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to ﬁll the entire box.

The path to the image follows the letters **`url`**, and it is put inside **parentheses** and **quotes**.

If you search online, you will ﬁnd lots of resources that oﬀer background textures that you can use on your pages.
Background images are often the last thing on the page to load (which can make a website seem slow to load). As with any images you use online, if the size of the ﬁle is large it will take longer to download.
