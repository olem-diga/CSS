# 5. Repeating Images

**`background-repeat`** **`background-attachment`**
The **`background-repeat`** property can have four values:
- **`repeat`** - The background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically (the default way it is shown if the **`background-repeat`** property isn't used).
- **`repeat-x`** - The image is repeated horizontally only.
- **`repeat-y`** The image is repeated vertically only.
- **`no-repeat`** - The image is only shown once.

The **`background-attachment`** property speciÔ¨Åes whether a background image should stay in one position or move as the user scrolls up and down the page. It can have one of two values:
- **`fixed`** - The background image stays in the same position on the page.
- **`scroll`** - The background image moves up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page.
