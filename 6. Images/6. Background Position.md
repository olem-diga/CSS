# 6. Background Position

**`background-position`**
When an image is not being repeated, you can use the **`background-position`** property to specify where in the browser window the background image should be placed. This property usually has a pair of values. The Ô¨Årst represents the horizontal position and the second represents the vertical.

<figure align="center">
<img src="Background Position.png" width ="60%" />
<figcaption>  </figcaption>
</figure>

If you only specify one value, the second value will default to center. You can also use a pair of **pixels** or **percentages**. These represent the distance from the top left corner of the browser window (or containing box). The top left corner is equal to 0% 0%. 50% 50%, centers the image horizontally and vertically.
