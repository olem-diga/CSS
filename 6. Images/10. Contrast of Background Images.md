# 10. Contrast of Background Images

If you want to overlay text on a background image, contrast in order for the text to be legible.
## High Conctrast

The majority of photographs have quite a high contrast, which means that they are not ideal for use as a background image.
## Low Contrast

Image editing applications such as Photoshop and GIMP have tools that allow you to manually adjust your images to have lower contrast.
## Screen

To overlay text on an image with high contrast, you can place a semi-transparent background color (or “screen”) behind the text to improve legibility.
