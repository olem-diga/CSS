# 2. Aligning Images Using CSS

In the last chapter, you saw how the **`float`** property can be used to move an element to the **left** or the **right** of its containing block, allowing text to ï¬‚ow around it.

Rather than using the **`<img>`** element's **`align`** attribute, web page authors are increasingly using the **`float`** property to align images. There are two ways that this is commonly achieved:
1. The **`float`** property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image (such as the **`small`** class).
2. New classes are created with names such as **`align-left`** or **`align-right`** to align the images to the **left** or **right** of the page. These class names are used in addition to classes that indicate the size of the image.

It is also common to add a margin to the image to ensure that the text does not touch their edges.
