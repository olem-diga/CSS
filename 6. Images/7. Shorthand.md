# 7. Shorthand

**`background`**
The **`background`** property acts like a shorthand for all of the other background properties you have just seen, and also the **`background-color`** property.

The properties must be speciﬁed in the following order, but you can miss any value if you do not want to specify it.
1. **`background-color`**
2. **`background-image`**
3. **`background-repeat`**
4. **`background-attachment`**
5. **`background-position`**

CSS3 will also support the use of multiple background images by repeating the background shorthand. Because few browsers supported this property at the time of writing, it was not commonly used.
```css
div {
background:
	url(example-1.jpg)
	top left no-repeat,
	urlexample-2.jpg)
	bottom left no-repeat,
	urlexample-3.jpg)
	centre top repeat-x;}
```

The ﬁrst image is shown on top, with the last one on the bottom.
