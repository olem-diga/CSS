# 9. CSS3 - Gradients

**`background-image`**
CSS3 is going to introduce the ability to specify a gradient for the background of a box. The gradient is created using the **`background-image`** property and, at the time of writing, diﬀerent browsers required a diﬀerent syntax.

Since it is not supported by all browsers, it is possible to specify a background image for the box ﬁrst (which would represent the gradient) and then provide the CSS alternatives for browsers that support gradients.

In order to create a linear gradient, we need to specify two colors (that the gradient is between).

Some browsers allow you to specify the angle of the gradient, or even diﬀerent types of gradients (such as radial gradients), but support is not as widespread as that for linear gradients.
