# 3. Positioning The Marker

**`list-style-position`**
Lists are indented into the page by default and the **`list-style-position`** property indicates whether the marker should appear on the inside or the outside of the box containing the main points.

This property can take one of two values:
**`outside`**
The marker sits to the *left* of the block of text. (This is the default behaviour if this property is not used.)
**`inside`**
The marker sits inside the box of text (which is indented).
