# 10. Cursor Styles

**`cursor`**
The **`cursor`** property allows you to control the type of mouse cursor that should be displayed to users.

For example, on a form you might set the cursor to be a hand when the user hovers over it.
Here are the most commonly used values for this property:
**`auto`**
**`crosshair`**
**`default`**
**`pointer`**
**`move`**
**`text`**
**`wait`**
**`help`**
**`url(“cursor.gif”);`**

You should only use these values to add helpful information for users in places they would expect to see that cursor. (For example, using a crosshair on a link might confuse users because they are not used to seeing it.)
