# 7. Gaps Between Cells

**`border-spacing`**, **`border-collapse`**
The **`border-spacing`** property allows you to control the distance between adjacent cells. By default, browsers often leave a small gap between each table cell, so if you want to increase or decrease this space then the **`border-spacing`** property allows you to control the gap.

The value of this property is usually speciÔ¨Åed in **pixels**. You can specify two values if desired to specify separate numbers for **horizontal** and **vertical** spacing.

When a border has been used on table cells, where two cells meet, the width of lines would be twice that of the outside edges. It is possible to collapse adjacent borders to prevent this using the **`border-collapse`** property. Possible values are:
**`collapse`** - Borders are collapsed into a single border where possible. (**`border-spacing`** will be ignored and cells pushed together, and **`empty-cells`** properties will be ignored.)
**`separate`** - Borders are detached from each other. (**`border-spacing`** and **`empty-cells`** will be obeyed.)
