# 5. Table Properties

**`width`** - to set the width of the table
**`padding`** - to set the space between the border of each table cell and its content
**`text-transform`** - to convert the content of the table headers to uppercase
**`letter-spacing`** - font-size to add additional styling to the content of the table headers
**`border-top`**, **`border-bottom`** to set borders above and below the table headers
**`text-align`** to align the writing to the left of some table cells and to the right of the others
**`background-color`** to change the background color of the alternating table rows
**`:hover`** to highlight a table row when a user's mouse goes over it

***Here are some tips for styling tables to ensure they are clean and easy to follow:***
- **GIVE CELLS PADDING** -  If the text in a table cell either touches a border (or another cell), it becomes much harder to read. Adding padding helps to improve readability.
- **DISTINGUISH HEADINGS** - Putting all table headings in bold (the default style for the **`<th>`** element) makes them easier to read. You can also make headings uppercase and then either add a background color or an underline to clearly distinguish them from content.
- **SHADE ALTERNATE ROWS** - Shading every other row can help users follow along the lines. Use a subtle distinction from the normal color of the rows to keep the table looking clean.
- **ALIGN NUMERALS** - You can use the **`text-align`** property to align the content of any column that contains numbers to the right, so that large numbers are clearly distinguished from smaller ones.
