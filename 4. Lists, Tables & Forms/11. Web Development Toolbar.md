# 11. Web Development Toolbar

This helpful extension for Firefox and Chrome provides tools to show you the CSS styles that apply to an element when you hover over it, along with the structure of the HTML.

Download this tool from: www.chrispederick.com/work/web-developer

To see the CSS styles and HTML structure of a web page, go to the CSS menu of the Web Developer Toolbar and pick View Style Information.
### 1: Outlines

When you hover over an element, a red outline will be drawn around it, showing you how much space the element takes up.
### 2: Structure

While you are hovering over an element, the structure will be shown at the top of the window. 
### 3: CSS Styles

When hovering over an element, click with your mouse to display the CSS. You will be shown the rules that apply to that element (and the line they are on). Above the rules, you can see the name of the style sheet (and the path to it).

This helps check which styles are being applied to an element. You can use it on code for your own site or when you want to see what styles someone else is using on their site.

This tool also allows you to change the screen size, validate your HTML and CSS code, and turn oï¬€ images.
