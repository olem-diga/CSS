# 8. Styling Forms

Nobody I know enjoys ﬁlling in forms, so if you can make yours look more attractive and easier to use, more people are likely to ﬁll it in. Also, when you come to look at a form in a few diﬀerent browsers (as shown below), you will see that each browser displays them diﬀerently.

<figure align="center">
<img src="Forms.png" width ="60%" />
<figcaption>  </figcaption>
</figure>

CSS is commonly used to control the appearance of form elements. This is both to make them more attractive and to make them more consistent across diﬀerent browsers 

It is most common to style:
- Text inputs and text areas
- Submit buttons
- Labels on forms, to get the form controls to align nicely

Styling text inputs and submit buttons is fairly easy. It is harder to get select boxes, radio buttons, and checkboxes to look consistent across all browsers. To achieve this, you might like to download the CSS ﬁles available at http://formalize.me .
The author of this website has done the hard work of making forms look consistent across browsers. Although the solution incorporates JavaScript, no prior knowledge of this is needed in order to implement the code.
## 8.1. Styling Text Inputs

- **`font-size`** - sets the size of the text entered by the user.
- **`color`** - sets the text color, and **`background-color`** sets the background color of the input.
- **`border`** - adds a border around the edge of the input box, and **`border-radius`** can be used to create rounded corners (for browsers that support this property).
- The **`:focus`** - pseudo-class is used to change the background color of the text input when it is being used, and the **`:hover`** psuedo-class applies the same styles when the user hovers over them.
- **`background-image`** adds a background image to the box. Because there is a diﬀerent image for each input, we are using an attribute selector looking for the value of the **`id`** attribute on each input.
## 8.2. Styling Submit Buttons

Here are some properties that can be used to style submit buttons. 

**`color`** - is used to change the color of the text on the button.
**`text-shadow`** - can give a 3D look to the text in browsers that support this property.
**`border-bottom`** has been used to make the bottom border of the button slightly thicker, which gives it a more 3D feel.
**`background-color`** can make the submit button stand out from other items around it. (Creating a consistent style for all buttons helps users understand how they should interact with the site.) A gradient background has been added for browsers that support gradients.
The **`:hover`** pseudo-class has been used to change the appearance of the button when the user hovers over it.
## 8.3. Styling Fieldsets & Legends

**Fieldsets** are particularly helpful in determining the edges of a form. In a long form they can help group together related information within it.
The **legend** is used to indicate what information is required in the ﬁeldset.

Properties commonly used with these two elements include:
**`width`** is used to control the width of the ﬁeldset.
**`color`** is used to control the color of text.
**`background-color`** is used to change the color behind these items.
**`border`** is used to control the appearance of the border around the ﬁeldset and/or legend.
**`border-radius`** is used to soften the edges of these elements in browsers that support this property.
**`padding`** can be used to add space inside these elements.
