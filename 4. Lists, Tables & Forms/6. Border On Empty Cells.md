# 6. Border On Empty Cells

**`empty-cells`**
If you have empty cells in your table, then you can use the empty-cells property to specify whether or not their borders should be shown.

Since browsers treat empty cells in diï¬€erent ways, if you want to explicitly show or hide borders on any empty cells then you should use this property.

It can take one of three values:
**`show`** - This shows the borders of any empty cells.
**`hide`** - This hides the borders of any empty cells.
**`inherit`** - If you have one table nested inside another, the inherit value instructs the table cells to obey the rules of the containing table.
