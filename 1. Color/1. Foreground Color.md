# 1. Foreground Color

The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
- **RGB VALUES**: These express colours in terms of how much `red`, `green` and `blue` are used to make it up. 
	- For example: `rgb(100,100,90)`
- **HEX CODES**: These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of `red`, `green` and `blue` in a color, preceded by a pound or hash `#` sign. 
	- For example: `#ee3e80`
- **COLOR NAMES**: There are 147 predeÔ¨Åned color names that are recognized by browsers. 
	- For example: `DarkCyan`

CSS3 has also introduced another way to specify colors called **`HSLA`**.
