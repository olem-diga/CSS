# CSS3 - HSL & HSLA

## hsl, hsla

Because older browsers do not recognize **HSL** and **HSLA** values, it is a good idea to add an extra rule which speciﬁes the color using a **hex code**, **RGB value**, or **color name**. This should appear before the rule that uses the HSL or HSLA value. This provides a fallback because if there are two rules that apply to the same element in CSS, the latter of the two always takes priority. This means that if the browser understands HSL and HSLA colors, it will use that rule; and if it does not, it will use the ﬁrst rule.

The **hsl** color property has been introduced in CSS3 as an alternative way to specify colors.

The **hsla** color property allows you to specify color properties using **hue**, **saturation**, and **lightness** as with **hsl**, and adds a fourth value which represents **transparency** (just like the **rgba** property). The **a** stands for: **Alpha**
## alpha

This is expressed as a number between **`0`** and **`1.0`**. For example, **`0.5`** represents **`50%`** transparency, and **`0.75`** represents **`75%`** transparency.
