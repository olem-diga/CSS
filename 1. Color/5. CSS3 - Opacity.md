**`CSS3`** introduces the **opacity** property which allows you to specify the **opacity** of an element and any of its child elements. The value is a number between **`0.0`** and **`1.0`** (so a value of **`0.5`** is **`50%`** opacity and **`0.15`** is **`15%`** opacity).

The **`CSS3`** **rgba** property allows you to specify a **color**, just like you would with an RGB value, but adds a fourth value to indicate **opacity**. This value is known as an **alpha** value and is a number between **`0.0`** and **`1.0`** (so a value of **`0.5`** is **`50%`** opacity and **`0.15`** is **`15%`** opacity). 

The **rgba** value will only aﬀect the element on which it is applied (not child elements).

Because some browsers will not recognize **RGBA** colors, you can oﬀer a fallback so that they display a solid color. If there are two rules that apply to the same element, the latter of the two will take priority. To create the fallback, you can specify a color as a **hex code**, **color name** or **RGB value**, followed by the rule that speciﬁes an **RGBA** value. If the browser understands **RGBA** colors it will use that rule. If it doesn't, it will use the **RGB** value.

At the time of writing, the **opacity** and **rgba** properties are only supported by the most recent browsers.
