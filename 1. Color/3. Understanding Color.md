# Understanding Color

Computer monitors are made up of thousands of tiny squares called **pixels**.

When the screen is not turned on, it's black because it's not emitting any light. When it's on, each pixel can be a diﬀerent color, creating a picture.

The color of every pixel on the screen is expressed in terms of a mix of **`red`**, **`green`**, and **`blue`**.
