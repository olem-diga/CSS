# 18. Indenting Text

**`text-indent`**
The **`text-indent`** property allows you to indent the ﬁrst line of text within an element. The amount you want the line indented by can be speciﬁed in a number of ways but is usually given in **pixels** or **ems**.

It can take a negative value, which means it can be used to push text oﬀ the browser window.
