# 8. More Font Choice

**`@font-face`**
**`@font-face`** allows you to use a font, even if it is not installed on the computer of the person browsing, by allowing you to specify a path to a copy of the font, which will be downloaded if it is not on the user's machine.

Because this technique allows a version of the font to be downloaded to the user's computer, it is important that the license for the font permits it to be used in this way.

You add the font to your style sheet using the **`@font-face`** rule.

**`font-family`**
This speciﬁes the name of the font. This name can then be used as a value of the font-family property in the rest of the style sheet.

**`src`**
This speciﬁes the path to the font. In order for this technique to work in all browsers, you will probably need to specify paths to a few diﬀerent versions of the font.

**`format`**
This speciﬁes the format that the font is supplied in. 

Many typeface makers do not allow you to use their fonts in this way, but there are open source fonts you can use freely. You can ﬁnd lists of them at:
- www.fontsquirrel.com
- www.fontex.org
- www.openfontlibrary.org

When looking at fonts on these sites, it is still important to check the font's license agreement because some fonts are only free for personal use (that is, not for use on commercial websites). There are some sites that give you access to use commercial fonts, because they negotiated permission to let their customers use these fonts for a fee:
- www.typekit.com
- www.kernest.com
- www.fontspring.com

Google also provides open source fonts. Rather than adding the **`@font-face`** rule to your own style sheet, you link to a CSS ﬁle and font ﬁles on their servers: www.google.com/webfonts
