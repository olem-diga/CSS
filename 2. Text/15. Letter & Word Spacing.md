# 15. Letter & Word Spacing

**`letter-spacing` , `word-spacing`**

**Kerning** is the term typographers use for the space between each letter. You can control the space between each letter with the **`letter-spacing`** property.

It is particularly helpful to increase the kerning when your heading or sentence is all in uppercase. If your text is in sentence (or normal) case, increasing or decreasing the kerning can make it harder to read.

You can also control the gap between words using the **`word-spacing`** property.

When you specify a value for these properties, it should be given in **ems**, and it will be added on top of the default value speciÔ¨Åed by the font.

The default gap between words is set by the typeface (often around 0.25em), and it is unlikely that you would need to change this property regularly. If the typeface is bold or you have increased the space between letters, then a larger gap between words can increase readability.
