# 10. Bold

**`font-weight`**
The **`font-weight`** property allows you to create bold text. There are two values that this property commonly takes:

**`normal`**
This causes text to appear at a normal weight.

**`bold`**
This causes text to appear bold.

You might wonder why there is a **normal** weight. This is because if, for example, you created a rule for the **`<body>`** element indicating that all text inside the body should appear **bold**, you might need an option that allows the text in certain instances to appear **normal** weight. So it is essentially used as an “oﬀ switch.”
