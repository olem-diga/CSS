# CSS Text

**The properties that allow you to control the appearance of text can be split into two groups:**
- Those that directly aﬀect the font and its appearance (including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic, and the size of the text)
- Those that would have the same eﬀect on text no matter what font you were using (including the color of text and the spacing between words and letters)

The formatting of your text can have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on how readable your pages are.
