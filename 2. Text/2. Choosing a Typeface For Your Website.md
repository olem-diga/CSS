# 2. Choosing a Typeface For Your Website

When choosing a typeface, it is important to understand that a browser will usually only display it if it's installed on that user's computer.
## Serif

Serif fonts have extra details on the end of the main strokes of the letters.
Examples:
- Georgia
- Times
- Times New Roman
## Sans-Serif

Sans-serif fonts have straight ends to letters and therefore have a much cleaner design.
Examples:
- Arial
- Verdana
- Helvetica

As a result, sites often use a small set of typefaces that are installed on most computers (shown above). There are some techniques to get around this limitation.

It is possible to specify more than one typeface and create an order of preference (in case the user does not have your ﬁrst choice of typeface installed). This is sometimes referred to as a **font stack.**
## Monospace

Every letter in a monospace typeface is the same width. (Non-monospace fonts have diﬀerent widths.)
Examples:
<figure align="center">
<img src="Monospace - Courier.png" width ="30%" />
<figcaption>  </figcaption>
</figure>

## Cursive

Cursive fonts either have joining strokes or other cursive characteristics, such as handwriting styles.
Examples:
<figure align="center">
<img src="Cursive Fonts.png" width ="30%" />
<figcaption>  </figcaption>
</figure>

## Fantasy

Fantasy fonts are usually decorative fonts and are often used for titles. They're not designed for long bodies of text.
<figure align="center">
<img src="Fantasy Fonts.png" width ="30%" />
<figcaption>  </figcaption>
</figure>

Browsers are supposed to support at least one typeface from each of the groups above. For this reason, it is common to add the generic font name after your preferred choice of typefaces.

For example, if you wanted serif type, you could write the following:

```css
font-family: Georgia, Times, serif;
```
