# 13. Underline & Strike

**`text-decoration`**
The text-decoration property allows you to specify the following values:

**`none`**
This removes any decoration already applied to the text.

**`underline`**
This adds a line underneath the text.

**`overline`**
This adds a line over the top of the text.

**`line-through`**
This adds a line through words.

**`blink`**
This animates the text to make it ﬂash on and oﬀ (however this is generally frowned upon, as it is considered rather annoying).
