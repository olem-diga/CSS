# 6. Type Scales

You may have noticed that programs such as Word, Photoshop and InDesign oﬀer the same sizes of text.

This is because they are set according to a scale or ratio that was developed by European typographers in the sixteenth century.

It is considered that this scale for type is pleasing to the eye and it has therefore changed little in the last 400 years.

For this reason, when you are designing pages, using sizes from this scale will help them look more attractive.

On the next page, you can see how to achieve this scale using pixels, percentages, and ems.

Print designers often refer to the size of text in terms of **points** rather than pixels (hence the use of **`pt`** in the scale). A **pixel** roughly equates to a **point** because a point corresponds to 1/72 of an inch, and most computer displays have a resolution of 72 dots per inch.

The default size of text in a browser is **`16 pixels`**.  So if you use *percentages* or *ems*, you calculate the size of text you want based on the default size of the text used in browsers. For example, you could scale down to **`12 pixels`** for body copy and scale up to **``24 pixels``** for headings.

Recently, some web designers have started to leave the body text at the default size of **`16 pixels`** and adjust the other font sizes using a scale that keeps the relative proportions of this one.

When you ﬁrst see body text at **`16 pixels`**, it might seem quite large. Once you get used to the larger type, however, most people ﬁnd it far easier to read; and going back to a page where main type is **`12 pixels`** will often then look quite small.
