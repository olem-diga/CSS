# 20. First Letter or Line

**`:first-letter` , `:first-line`**
You can specify diﬀerent values for the ﬁrst letter or ﬁrst line of text inside an element using **`:first-letter`** and **`:first-line.`**

Technically these are not properties. They are known as **pseudo-elements**.

You specify the pseudo-element at the end of the selector, and then specify the declarations as you would normally for any other element.

**CSS** introduces both **pseudo-elements** and **pseudo-classes**. 
- A pseudo-element acts like an extra element is in the code. In the case of the **`:first-letter`** and **`:first-line`** pseudo elements, it is as if there is an extra element around the ﬁrst letter or the ﬁrst line which can have its own styles applied.
- A pseudo-class acts like an extra value for a class attribute. In the case of the **`:visited`** pseudo-class, it allows you to have diﬀerent styles for links that have been visited. Similarly, the **`:hover`** pseudo-class allows you to style elements diﬀerently when a user hovers over them.
