# 1. Typeface Terminology
## Serif

**Serif** fonts have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letters. These details are known as **serifs**.

In print, serif fonts were traditionally used for long passages of text because they were considered easier to read.
## Sans-Serif

Sans-serif fonts have straight ends to letters, and therefore have a much cleaner design.

Screens have a lower resolution than print. So, if the text is small, sans-serif fonts can be clearer to read.
## Monospace

Every letter in a monospace (or ﬁxed-width) font is the same width. (Non-monospace fonts have diﬀerent widths.)

Monospace fonts are commonly used for code because they align nicely, making the text easier
to follow.

## Weight

The font weight not only adds emphasis but can also aﬀect the amount of white space and contrast on a page.
## Style

*Italic* fonts have a cursive aspect to some of the lettering. 
*Oblique* font styles take the normal style and put it on an angle.
## Stretch

In *condensed* (or narrow) versions of the font, letters are thinner and closer together. 
In *expanded* versions they are thicker and further apart.
