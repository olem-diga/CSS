# 22. Responding To Users

**`:hover` , `:active` , `focus`**

There are three pseudo-classes that allow you to change the appearance of elements when a user is interacting with them.

**`:hover`**
This is applied when a user hovers over an element with a pointing device such as a mouse. This has commonly been used to change the appearance of links and buttons when a user places their cursor over them. It is worth noting that such events do not work on devices that use touch screens because the screen is not able to tell when someone is hovering their Ô¨Ånger over an element.

**`:active`**
This is applied when an element is being activated by a user; for example, when a button is being pressed or a link being clicked. Sometimes this is used to make a button or link feel more like it is being pressed by changing the style or position of the element slightly.

**`:focus`**
This is applied when an element has focus. Any element that you can interact with, such as a link you can click on or any form control can have focus.

Focus occurs when a browser discovers that you are ready to interact with an element on the page. For example, when your cursor is in a form input ready to accept typing, that element is said to have focus. It is also possible to use the tab key on your keyboard to move through the interactive items on a page. When pseudo-classes are used, they should appear in this order:
**`:link, :visited, :hover, :focus, :active.`**
