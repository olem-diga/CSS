# 14. Leading

**`line-height`**
Leading (pronounced *ledding*) is a term typographers use for the vertical space between lines of text. In a typeface, the part of a letter that drops beneath the baseline is called a **descender**, while the highest point of a letter is called the **ascender**. Leading is measured from the bottom of the descender on one line to the top of the ascender on the next.

In CSS, the line-height property sets the height of an entire line of text, so the diï¬€erence between the **`font-size`** and the **`line-height`** is equivalent to the *leading* (as shown in the diagram above).

Increasing the line-height makes the vertical gap between lines of text larger.

Increasing the default amount of leading can make text easier to read. The vertical space between lines should be larger than the space between each word as this helps the eye move along the line instead of down them. A good starter setting is around **`1.4`** to **`1.5em`**. Because users can adjust the default size of text in their browser, the value of the line-height property is best given in **`ems`**, not **`pixels`**, so that the gap between lines is relative to the size of text the user has selected.
