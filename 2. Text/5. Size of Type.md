# 5. Size of Type
**`font-size`**

The font-size property enables you to specify a size for the font. There are several ways to specify the size of a font. The most common are:
## Pixels

**Pixels** are commonly used because they allow web designers very precise control over how much space their text takes up. The number of pixels is followed by the letters **`px`**.
## Percentages

The default size of text in browsers is **`16px`**. So a size of **`75%`** would be the equivalent of **`12px`**, and **`200%`** would be **`32px`**.

If you create a rule to make all text inside the **`<body>`** element to be **`75%`** of the default size (to make it **`12px`**), and then specify another rule that indicates the content of an element inside the **`<body>`** element should be **`75%`** size, it will be **`9px`** (**`75%`** of the **`12px`** font size).
## EMS

An **`em`** is equivalent to the width of a letter **`m`**.
