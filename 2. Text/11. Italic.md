# 11. Italic

**`font-style`**
If you want to create italic text, you can use the **`font-style`** property. There are three values this property can take:

**`normal`**
This causes text to appear in a normal style (as opposed to **italic** or **oblique**).

**`italic`**
This causes text to appear **italic**.

**`oblique`**
This causes text to appear **oblique**.

*Italic* fonts were traditionally stylized versions of the font based on calligraphy, whereas an *oblique* version would take the normal version and put it on an angle.

It is not unusual for the browser to fail to Ô¨Ånd an italic version of a typeface, in which case it will use an algorithm to place the normal version of the type on a slant, which means that a lot of italic text online is actually *oblique*.
