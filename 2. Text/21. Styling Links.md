# 21. Styling Links

**`:link` , `:visited`**
Browsers tend to show links in blue with an underline by default, and they will change the color of links that have been visited to help users know which pages they have been to.

In CSS, there are two **pseudo-classes** that allow you to set diﬀerent styles for links that have and have not yet been visited.

**`:link`**
This allows you to set styles for links that have not yet been visited.

**`:visited`**
This allows you to set styles for links that have been clicked on. They are commonly used to control colors of the links and also whether they are to appear underlined or not.

Visited links are shown in a diﬀerent color to help visitors know what they have already seen.
Often, the **`:hover`** and **`:active`** pseudo-classes (covered next) are used to alter the appearance of a link when a user hovers over or clicks on it.
