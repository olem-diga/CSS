Setting font size in pixels is the best way to ensure that the type appears at the size you intended (because percentages and ems are more likely to vary if a user has changed the default size of text in their browser).

Pixels are relative to the resolution of the screen, so the same type size will look larger when a screen has a resolution of **`800×600`** than it would when it is **`1280×800`**.

You can also use **pt** for point sizes instead of **px** for pixels, but you should only do this when creating style sheets for printer-friendly versions of pages.

The default size of text in a web browser is **`16 pixels`**. Using percentages of this amount, you can create a scale where the default text size is **`12 pixels`**, and headings are sized in relation to this.

It is possible for users to change the default size of text in their web browsers. If they have done this, the fonts will be displayed at the same scale that the designer intended, but at a larger size.

**`Ems`** allow you to change the size of text relative to the size of the text in the parent element. Since the default size of text in web browsers is **`16 pixels`**, you can use similar rules to those shown for percentages.

Because users can change the default size of text in their browser, the fonts could all appear larger (or smaller) than the designer intended.

The extra **`p`** rule above is to help Internet Explorer 6 and 7 display the fonts at the right size. Without this extra rule, IE6 and IE7 exaggerate the relative sizes of other text.
