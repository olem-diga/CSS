# 19. CSS3 - Drop Shadow

**`text-shadow`**
The **`text-shadow`** property has become commonly used despite lacking support in all browsers.

It is used to create a drop shadow, which is a dark version of the word just behind it and slightly oﬀset. It can also be used to create an embossed eﬀect by adding a shadow that is slightly lighter than the text.

The value of this property is quite complicated because it can take three lengths and a color for the drop shadow.
- The ﬁrst length indicates how far to the **left** or **right** the shadow should fall.
- The second value indicates the distance to the **top** or **bottom** that the shadow should fall.
- The third value is optional and speciﬁes the amount of **blur** that should be applied to the drop shadow.
- The fourth value is the **color** of the drop shadow.

The text-shadow property has become very popular but at the time of writing it was not supported in any versions of Internet Explorer (currently IE9). Other browser makers introduced it in Firefox 3.1, Safari 3, Chrome 2 and Opera 9.5.
