# 17. Vertical Alignment

**`vertical-align`**
The vertical-align property is a common source of confusion. It is not intended to allow you to vertically align text in the middle of block level elements such as **`<p>`** and **`<div>`**, although it does have this eﬀect when used with table cells (the **`<td>`** and **`<th>`** elements).

It is more commonly used with inline elements such as <img>, **`<em>`**, or **`<strong>`** elements. When used with these elements, it performs a task very similar to the HTML **`align`** attribute used on the **`<img>`** element. The values it can take are:

**`baseline`**
**`sub`**
**`super`**
**`top`**
**`text-top`**
**`middle`**
**`bottom`**
**`text-bottom`**

It can also take a **length** (usually speciﬁed in pixels or ems) or a **percentage** of the line height.
