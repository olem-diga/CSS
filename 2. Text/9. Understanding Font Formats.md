Because the browser needs to download the font ﬁle in order to show it, users might see omething known as a **Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC)** or **Flash of Unstyled Text (FOUT)**. Two things you can do to try to minimize this behavior are to delete any unneccesary glyphs from the font and/or host the font on a Content Delivery Network (a special type of web hosting that oﬀers faster delivery of ﬁles).

Diﬀerent browsers support diﬀerent formats for fonts (in the same way that they support diﬀerent audio and video formats), so you will need to supply the font in several variations to reach all browsers.

If you do not have all of these formats for your font, you can upload the font to a website called FontSquirrel where they will convert it for you: www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator

Font Squirrel also provides you with the CSS code for the **`@font-face`** rule. This is very helpful because, when you are dealing with multiple font formats, the src and format properties of the **`@font-face`** rule can get rather complicated.

The various font formats should appear in your code in this order:
1. **`eot`**
2. **`woff`**
3. **`ttf/otf`**
4. **`svg`**
