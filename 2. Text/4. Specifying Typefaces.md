# 4. Specifying Typefaces

**`font-family`**

The **`font-family`** property allows you to specify the typeface that should be used for any text inside the element(s) to which a CSS rule applies.

The value of this property is the name of the typeface you want to use.

The people who are visiting your site need the typeface you have speciﬁed installed on their computer in order for it to be displayed.

You can specify a list of fonts separated by commas so that, if the user does not have your ﬁrst choice of typeface installed, the browser can try to use an alternative font from the list. It is also common to end with a generic font name for that type of font.

If a font name is made up of more than one word, it should be put in double quotes. Designers suggest pages usually look better if they use no more than three typefaces on a page.
