# 12. Uppercase & Lowercase

**`text-transform`**
The **text-transform** property is used to change the case of text giving it one of the following values:

**`uppercase`**
This causes the text to appear uppercase.

**`lowercase`**
This causes the text to appear lowercase.

**`capitalize`**
This causes the Ô¨Årst letter of each word to appear capitalized.

If you do utilize the uppercase option, it is worth looking at the letter-spacing property to increase the gap between each letter. This will help improve readability.
