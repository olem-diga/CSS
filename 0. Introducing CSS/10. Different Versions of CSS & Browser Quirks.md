# Different Versions of CSS & Browser Quirks

**CSS1** was released in **1996** and **CSS2** followed two years later. Work on **CSS3** has been ongoing but the major browsers have already started to implement it.

Any seasoned user of CSS will tell you that some browsers display a few of the CSS properties in an unexpected way. But finding and squashing those bugs is easy when you know how...

Before launching any new site, it is important to test it in more than one browser, because there can be slight differences in how browsers display the pages.

You do not need lots of computers to test your site, as there are online tools to show you what a page looks like in multiple browsers:
- www.BrowserCam.com
- www.BrowserLab.Adobe.com
- www.BrowserShots.org
- www.CrossBrowserTesting.com

Using these tools, it is a good idea to check the site on different operating systems (PC, Mac, and Linux) and in older versions of the major browsers, as well as recent versions.

When you look at your site in more than one browser, you might find that some elements on your page do not look as you expect them to. 

When a CSS property does not display as expected, it is generally referred to as a browser quirk or CSS bug. Some common browser bugs are discussed in this book, but there are many smaller bugs that only occur in rare situations, or on old browsers that few people use.

If you come across a CSS bug, you can use your favorite search engine to try and find a solution. Or you can check these sites:
