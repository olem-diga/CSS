# CSS Properties Affect How Elements Are Displayed

CSS **declarations** sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a ***property*** and a ***value***, separated by a ***colon***. You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.

```css
h1, h2, h3 {
	font-family: Arial;
	color: yellow;
}
```

This rule indicates that all `<h1>`, `<h2>` and `<h3>` elements should be shown in the Arial typeface, in a yellow color.
- ***Properties*** indicate the aspects of the element you want to change. For example, color, font, width, height and border.
- ***Values*** specify the settings you want to use for the chosen properties. For example, if you want to specify a color property then the value is the color you want the text in these elements to be.
