# CSS Associates Style Rules with HTML Elements

CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements.

These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed.

A CSS rule contains two parts: a **selector** and a **declaration**.

```css
p { 
	font-family: Arial;}
```

This rule indicates that all `<p>` elements should be shown in the Arial typeface.
- ***Selectors*** indicate which element the rule applies to. The same rule can apply to more than one element if you separate the element names with commas.
- ***Declarations*** indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled. Declarations are split into two parts (a property and a value), and are separated by a colon.
