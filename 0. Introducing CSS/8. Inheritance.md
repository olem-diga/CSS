# Inheritance

If you specify the font-family or color properties on the **`<body>`** element, they will apply to most child elements. This is because the value of the font-family property is ***inherited*** by child elements. It saves you from having to apply these properties to as many elements (and results in simpler style sheets).

You can compare this with the **background-color** or **border** properties; they are not inherited by child elements. If these were inherited by all child elements then the page could look quite messy.

You can force a lot of properties to inherit values from their parent elements by using **`inherit`** for the value of the properties.
