# Understanding CSS - Thinking Inside The Box

The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.
### Block & Inline Elements

There is a difference between block level and inline elements and how how browsers display them.

Block level elements look like they start on a new line. Examples include the `<h1>` -`<h6>` , `<p>` and `<div>` elements.

Inline elements flow within the text and do not start on a new line. Examples include `<b>`, `<i>` , `<img>` , `<em>` and `<span>`.

CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.

Using CSS, you could add a border around any of the boxes, specify its width and height, or add a background color. You could also control text inside a box - for example, its color, size, and the typeface used.
