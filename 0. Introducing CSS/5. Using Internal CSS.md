# Using Internal CSS

**`<style>`**
- You can also include CSS rules within an HTML page by placing them inside a **`<style>`** element, which usually sits inside the `<head>` element of the page.
- The **`<style>`** element should use the **`type`** attribute to indicate that the styles are specified in CSS. The value should be **`text/css`**.

When building a site with more than one page, you should use an external CSS style sheet. This:
- Allows all pages to use the same style rules (rather than repeating them in each page).
- Keeps the content separate from how the page looks.
- Means you can change the styles used across all pages by altering just one file (rather than each individual page).
