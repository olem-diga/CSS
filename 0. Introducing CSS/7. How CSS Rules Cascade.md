# How CSS Rules Cascade

If there are two or more rules that apply to the same element, it is important to understand which will take precedence.
### Last Rule

If the two selectors are identical, the latter of the two will take precedence.
### Specificity

If one selector is more specific than the others, the more specific rule will take precedence over more general ones.
### Important

You can add **`!important`** after any property value to indicate that it should be considered more important than other rules that apply to the same element.

Understanding how CSS rules cascade means you can write simpler style sheets because you can create generic rules that apply to most elements and then override the properties on individual elements that need to appear differently.
