# CSS Selectors

There are many different types of CSS selector that allow you to target rules to specific elements in an HTML document.

The table below introduces the most commonly used CSS selectors.

Before that, there is an HTML file to demonstrate which elements these CSS selectors would apply to.

CSS selectors are *case sensitive*, so they must match element names and attribute values exactly. 

There are some more advanced selectors which allow you to select elements based on attributes and their values.
