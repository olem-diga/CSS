# 20. CSS3 - Elliptical Shapes

**`border-radius`**
To create more complex shapes, you can specify diﬀerent distances for the horizontal and the vertical parts of the rounded corners.

There is also a shorthand for targetting all four corners at once; ﬁrst you specify the four horizontal values, then the four vertical values.

You can even create a circle by taking a square box and making the border-radius the same height as the square.
