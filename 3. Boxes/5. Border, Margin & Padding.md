# 5. Border, Margin & Padding

Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance:
**`BORDER`**
Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is speciÔ¨Åed to be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another.

**`MARGIN`**
Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.

**`PADDING`**
Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.

If you specify a width for a box, then the borders, margin, and padding are added to its width and height.
