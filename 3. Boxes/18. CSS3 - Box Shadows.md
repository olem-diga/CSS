# 18. CSS3 - Box Shadows

**`box-shadow`**
The **`box-shadow`** property allows you to add a drop shadow around a box. It works just like the **`text-shadow`** property. It must use at least the ﬁrst of these two values as well as a color:
- **`HORIZONTAL OFFSET`** - Negative values position the shadow to the left of the box.
- **`VERTICAL OFFSET`** - Negative values position the shadow to the top of the box.
- **`BLUR DISTANCE`** - If omitted, the shadow is a solid line like a border.
- **`SPREAD OF SHADOW`** - If used, a positive value will cause the shadow to expand in all directions, and a negative value will make it contract.

The **`inset`** keyword can also be used before these values to create an *inner-shadow*.

Chrome, Firefox, and Safari were quick to support this property using the **`-moz-box-shadow`** and **`-webkit-box-shadow`** properties. These are not in the CSS speciﬁcation but using them can help this style to work in these browsers.
