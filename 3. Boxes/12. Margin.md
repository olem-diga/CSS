# 12. Margin

**`margin`**
The value of the **`margin`** property is not inherited by child elements in the same way that the **`color`** value of the **`font-family`** property is, so you need to specify the margin for every element that needs to use it.

Up until Internet Explorer 6, the **`width`** of the box would include the **`padding`** and **`margins`**.

The **`margin`** property controls the gap between boxes. Its value is commonly given in **pixels**, although you may also use **percentages** or **ems**.

If one box sits on top of another, margins are collapsed, which means the larger of the two margins will be used and the smaller will be disregarded.

**Please note:** If the **`width`** of a box is speciÔ¨Åed then the **`margin`** is added to the **`width`** of the box.
You can specify values for each side of a box using:
**`margin-top`**
**`margin-right`**
**`margin-bottom`**
**`margin-left`**

You can also use the shorthand (where the values are in clockwise order: *top, right, bottom, left*):

```css
margin: 1px 2px 3px 4px;
```

Sometimes you might see the following, which means that the left and right margins should be
10 pixels and the top and bottom margins should be 20 pixels: 

```css
margin: 10px 20px;
```

(This same shorthand shown above can also be applied to padding.)
