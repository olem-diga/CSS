# 16. Hiding Boxes

**`visibility`**
The **`visibility`** property allows you to hide boxes from users but It leaves a space where the element would have been.
This property can take two values:
- **`hidden`** - This hides the element.
- **`visible`** - This shows the element.

If the **`visibility`** of an element is set to **`hidden`**, a blank space will appear in its place.

If you do not want a blank space to appear, then you should use the display property with a value of **`none`** instead.

Please note that anyone can view the contents of any elements whose visibility property has been set to **`hidden`** by viewing the source in their browser.
