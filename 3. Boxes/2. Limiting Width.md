# 2. Limiting Width

**`min-width`** , **`max-width`**
Some page designs expand and shrink to ﬁt the size of the user's screen. In such designs, the  **`min-width`**  property speciﬁes the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser window is narrow, and the **`max-width`** property indicates the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide.

These are very helpful properties to ensure that the content of pages are legible (especially on the smaller screens of handheld devices). For example, you can use the **`max-width`** property to ensure that lines of text do not appear too wide within a big browser window and you can use the **`min-width`** property to make sure that they do not appear too narrow.

Please note that these properties were ﬁrst supported in IE7 and Firefox 2 so they will not work in older versions of these browsers.
