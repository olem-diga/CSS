The padding and margin properties are very helpful in adding space between various items on the page. Designers refer to the space between items on a page as **white space**. Imagine you had a border around a box. You would not want the text to touch this border or it would become harder to read.

Or, imagine you had two boxes sitting side by side (each with a black border). You would not necessarily want the boxes to touch edges as this would make the line look twice as thick on the facing sides. 

If the bottom margin of any box touches the top margin of another, the browser will render it diﬀerently than you might expect. It will only show the larger of the two margins. If both margins are the same size, it will only show one.
