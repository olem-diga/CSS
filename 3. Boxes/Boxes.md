# Boxes

At the beginning of this section on CSS, you saw how CSS treats each HTML element as if it lives in its own box.

You can set several properties that aï¬€ect the appearance of these boxes. In this chapter you will see how to:
- Control the dimensions of your boxes
- Create borders around boxes
- Set margins and padding for boxes
- Show and hide boxes

Once you have learned how to control the appearance of each box, you will see how to position these boxes on your pages in the chapter on page layout.
