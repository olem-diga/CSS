# 4. Overflowing Content

**`overflow`**
The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have one of two values:
**`hidden`**
This property simply hides any extra content that does not ﬁt in the box.

**`scroll`**
This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content. 

The overflow property is particularly handy because some browsers allow users to adjust the size of the text to appear as large or as small as they want. If the text is set too large then the page can become an unreadable mess. Hiding the overﬂow on such boxes helps prevent items overlapping on the page.
