# 1. Box Dimensions

**`width`**, **`height`**

By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents. To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the **`height`** and **`width`** properties.

The most popular ways to specify the size of a box are to use **pixels**, **percentages**, or **ems**. Traditionally, **pixels** have been the most popular method because they allow designers to accurately control their size.

When you use **percentages**, the size of the box is relative to the size of the browser window or, if the box is encased within another box, it is a **percentage** of the size of the containing box.

When you use **ems**, the size of the box is based on the size of text within it. Designers have recently started to use **percentages** and **ems** more for measurements as they try to create designs that are ﬂexible across devices which have diﬀerent-sized screens.
