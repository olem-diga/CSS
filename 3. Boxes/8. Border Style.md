You can control the style of a border using the **`border-style`** property. This property can take the following values:
- **`solid`** - a single solid line
- **`dotted`** - a series of square dots (if your border is 2px wide, then the dots are 2px squared with a 2px gap between each dot)
- **`dashed`** - a series of short lines
- **`double`** - two solid lines (the value of the border-width property creates the sum of the two lines)
- **`groove`** - appears to be carved into the page
- **`ridge`** - appears to stick out from the page
- **`inset`** - appears embedded into the page
- **`outset`** - looks like it is coming out of the screen
- **`hidden`** / **`none`** - no border is shown

You can individually change the styles of diﬀerent borders using:
**`border-top-style`**
**`border-left-style`**
**`border-right-style`**
**`border-bottom-style`**
