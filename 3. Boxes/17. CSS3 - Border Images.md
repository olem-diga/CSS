# 17. CSS3 - Border Images

**`border-image`**
The **`border-image`** property applies an image to the border of any box. It takes a background image and slices it into nine pieces.
**This property requires three pieces of information:**
1. The URL of the image
2. Where to slice the image
3. What to do with the straight edges; the possible values are:
	- **`stretch`** stretches the image
	- **`repeat`** repeats the image
	- **`round`** like repeat but if the tiles do not Ô¨Åt exactly, scales the tile image so they wil

The box must also have a border width for the image to be shown.
