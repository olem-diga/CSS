# 11. Padding
**`padding`**
The padding property allows you to specify how much space should appear between the content of an element and its border.

The value of this property is most often speciﬁed in **pixels** (although it is also possible to use **percentages** or **ems**).
If a **percentage** is used, the padding is a **percentage** of the browser window (or of the containing box if it is inside another box).

**Please note:** If a **`width`** is speciﬁed for a box, **`padding`** is added onto the **`width`** of the box.

You can specify diﬀerent values for each side of a box using:
**`padding-top`**
**`padding-right`**
**`padding-bottom`**
**`padding-left`**

Or you can use a shorthand (where the values are in clockwise order: *top, right, bottom, left*):

```css
padding: 10px 5px 3px 1px;
```

The value of the **`padding`** property is not inherited by child elements in the same way that the **`color`** value of the **`font-family`** property is; so you need to specify the padding for every element that needs to use it.

Up until Internet Explorer 6, the width of the box would include the padding and margins.
