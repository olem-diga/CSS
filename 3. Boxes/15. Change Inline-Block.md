# 15. Change Inline/Block

**`display`**
The **`display`** property allows you to turn an inline element into a block-level element or vice versa, and can also be used to hide an element from the page.

The values this property can take are:
- **`inline`** - This causes a block-level element to act like an inline element.
- **`block`** - This causes an inline element to act like a block-level element.
- **`inline-block`** - This causes a block-level element to ï¬‚ow like an inline element, while retaining other features of a block-level element.
- **`none`** - This hides an element from the page. In this case, the element acts as though it is not on the page at all (although a user could still see the content of the box if they used the view source option in their browser).

If you use this property, it is important to note that inline boxes are **not** supposed to create block-level elements.
