# 13. Centering Content

If you want to center a box on the page (or center it inside the element that it sits in), you can set the **`left-margin`** and **`right-margin`** to **`auto`**.

In order to center a box on the page, you need to set a **`width`** for the box (otherwise it will take up the full width of the page).

Once you have speciÔ¨Åed the **`width`** of the box, setting the **`left`** and **`right`** margins to **`auto`** will make the browser put an equal gap on each side of the box. This centers the box on the page (or within the element that the box sits inside).

In order for this to work in older browsers (particularly IE6), the element that the box sits inside should have a **`text-align`** property with its value set to center.

The **`text-align`** property is inherited by child elements. You therefore also need to specify the **`text-align`** property on the centered box if you do not want the text inside it to be centered.
