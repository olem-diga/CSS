# 14. IE6 Box Model

When you specify the **`width`** of a box, any **`padding`** or **`margin`** should be added to the **`width`** of it. Internet Explorer 6, however, has a quirk whereby it includes the **`padding`** and **`margins`** in the **`width`** of the box.

The way around this is to ensure that you provide a DOCTYPE declaration for the HTML page. You can use either the HTML5, HTML 4 strict, or HTML 4 transitional DOCTYPE declarations to ensure that IE6 follows the correct box model.
