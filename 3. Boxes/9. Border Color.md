# 9. Border Color

**`border - color`**
You can specify the color of a border using either RGB values, hex codes or CSS color names.

It is possible to individually control the colors of the borders on diï¬€erent sides of a box using:
**`border-top-color`**
**`border-right-color`**
**`border-bottom-color`**
**`border-left-color`**

It is also possible to use a shorthand to control all four border colors in the one property:

```css
border-color: darkcyan deeppink darkcyan deeppink;
```

The values here appear in clockwise order: *top, right, bottom, left*.

You could also use **HSL** values to specify the color. However, these were only introduced in CSS3 and will not work in older browsers.
