# 4. Relative Positioning

**`position:relative`**
Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal ﬂow. For example, you can move it **`10 pixels`** lower than it would have been in normal ﬂow or **`20%`** to the right.

You can indicate that an element should be relatively positioned using the **`position`** property with a value of **`relative`**.
You then use the **`oﬀset`** properties (top or bottom and left or right) to indicate how far to move the element from where it would have been in normal ﬂow.

To move the box up or down, you can use either the **`top`** or **`bottom`** properties. To move the box horizontally, you can use either the **`left`** or **`right`** properties.
The values of the box oﬀset properties are usually given in pixels, percentages or ems.
