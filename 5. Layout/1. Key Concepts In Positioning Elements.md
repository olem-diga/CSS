# 1. Key Concepts In Positioning Elements
## Building Blocks

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
**Block-level boxes** start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout, while **inline boxes** ï¬‚ow between surrounding text. You can control how much space each box takes up by setting the **`width`** of the boxes (and sometimes the **`height`**, too). To separate boxes, you can use **borders**, **margins**, **padding**, and **background colors**.

*Block-Level Elements Start On A New Line*
Examples include:
**`<h1>`** **`<p>`** **`<ul>`** **`<li>`**

Inline Elements Flow In Between Surrounding Text
Examples include:
**`<img>`** **`<b>`** **`<i>`**
## Containing Elements

If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the **containing** or **parent** element.

It is common to group a number of elements together inside a **`<div>`** (or other block-level) element. For example, you might group together all of the elements that form the header of a site (such as the logo and the main navigation). The **`<div>`** element that contains this group of elements is then referred to as the **containing** element.

A box may be nested inside several other block-level elements. The containing element is always the direct parent of that element.
