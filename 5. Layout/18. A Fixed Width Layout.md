# 18. A Fixed Width Layout

To create a ﬁxed width layout, the width of the main boxes on a page will usually be speciﬁed in **pixels** (and sometimes their height, too).

The ﬁxed width layout will stay the same width no matter what size the browser window is, whereas the liquid layout will stretch (or shrink) to ﬁll the screen.

Sometimes an extra HTML element is used to contain the page, rather than ﬁxing the width of the **`<body>`**. This allows the background of the browser window to have a diﬀerent color than the background of the content.
