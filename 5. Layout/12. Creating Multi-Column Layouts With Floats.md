## 12. Creating Multi-Column Layouts With Floats

Many web pages use multiple columns in their design. This is achieved by using a **`<div>`**
element to represent each column. The following three CSS properties are used to position the
columns next to each other:
**`width`**
This sets the width of the columns.
**`float`**
This positions the columns next to each other.
**`margin`**
This creates a gap between the columns.
A two-column layout like the one shown on this page would need two **`<div>`** elements, one for
the main content of the page and one for the sidebar.
Inside each of the **`<div>`** elements there can be headings, paragraphs, images, and even other
**`<div>`** elements.
Similarly, a three column layout could be created by ï¬‚oating three **`<div>`** elements next to each other, as shown on this page.
