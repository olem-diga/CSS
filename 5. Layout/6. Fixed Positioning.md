It positions the element in relation to the browser window. Therefore, when a user scrolls down the page, it stays in the exact same place. It is a good idea to try this example in your browser to see the eﬀect.

To control where the ﬁxed position box appears in relation to the browser window, the box **`oﬀset`** properties are used.
