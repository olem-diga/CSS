# 5. Absolute Positioning

**`position:absolute`**
When the **`position`** property is given a value of **`absolute`**, the box is taken out of normal ﬂow and no longer aﬀects the position of other elements on the page. (They act like it is not there.)
The box **`oﬀset`** properties (top or bottom and left or right) specify where the element should appear in relation to its containing element.

By default, most browsers add a margin to the top of the **`<h1>`** element. This is why there is a gap between the top of the browser and the box containing the **`<h1>`** element. If you wanted to remove this margin, you could add the following code to the **`<h1>`** element's style rules:

```css
margin: 0px;
```
