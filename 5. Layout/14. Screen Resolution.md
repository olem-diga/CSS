# 14. Screen Resolution

**Resolution** refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

```
13″ MacBook
Size: 13.3 inches
Resolution: 1280 × 800 pixels
```

```
27″ iMac
Size: 27 inches
Resolution: 2560 × 1440 pixels
```

Most computers will allow owners to adjust the resolution of the display or the number of pixels that are shown on the screen. For example, here you can see the options to change the screen size from **`720 × 480 pixels`** up to **`1280 × 800 pixels`**.

It is interesting to note that **the higher the resolution, the smaller the text appears**. Many mobile devices have screens that are higher resolution than their desktop counterparts.
