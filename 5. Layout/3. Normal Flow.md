# 3. Normal Flow

**`position:static`**
In normal ﬂow, each block-level element sits on top of the next one. Since this is the default way in which browsers treat HTML elements, you do not need a CSS property to indicate that elements should appear in normal ﬂow, but the syntax would be:

```css
position: static;
```

Elements in normal ﬂow start on a new line even if they do not take up the full width of the browser window.
