# 11. Parent Of Floated Elements - Problem

If a containing element only contains ﬂoated elements, some browsers will treat it as if it is zero pixels tall.
## 11.1. Parent Of Floated Elements - Solution

Traditionally, developers got around this problem by adding an extra element after the last ﬂoated box (inside the containing element). A CSS rule would be applied to this additional element setting the **`clear`** property to have a value of **`both`**. But this meant that an extra element was added to the HTML just to ﬁx the height of the containing element.

More recently, developers have opted for a purely CSS-based solution because it means that there is no need to add an extra element to the HTML page after the ﬂoated elements. The pure CSS solution adds two CSS rules to the containing element:
- The **`overflow`** property is given a value **`auto`**.
- The **`width`** property is set to **`100%`**.
