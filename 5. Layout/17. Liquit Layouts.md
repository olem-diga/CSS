# 17. Liquit Layouts
## Advantages

- Pages expand to ﬁll the entire browser window so there are no spaces around the page on a large screen.
- If the user has a small window, the page can contract to ﬁt it without the user having to scroll to the side.
- The design is tolerant of users setting font sizes larger than the designer intended (because the page can stretch).
## Disadvantages

- If you do not control the width of sections of the page then the design can look very diﬀerent than you intended, with unexpected gaps around certain elements or items squashed together.
- If the user has a wide window, lines of text can become very long, which makes them harder to read.
- If the user has a very narrow window, words may be squashed and you can end up with few words on each line.
- If a ﬁxed width item (such as an image) is in a box that is too small to hold it (because the user has made the window smaller) the image can overﬂow over the text.
- Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use **percentages**.
- Because liquid layouts can stretch the entire width of the browser, resulting in long lines of text that are hard to read, some liquid layouts only let part of the page expand and contract. Other parts of the page have minimum and maximum widths.
