# 13. Screen Sizes

Diﬀerent visitors to your site will have diﬀerent sized screens that show diﬀerent amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of diﬀerent sized screens.

```

Resolution: 960 × 640 pixels

```
iPad 2
Size: 9.7 inches
Resolution: 1024 × 768 pixels

When designing for print, you always know the size of the piece of paper that your design will be printed on. However, when it comes to designing for the web, you are faced with the unique challenge that diﬀerent users will have diﬀerent sized screens.

Since computers have been sold to the public, the size of screens has been steadily increasing. This means that some people viewing your site might have 13 inch monitors while others may have 27+ inch monitors. The size of a user's screen aﬀects how big they can open their windows and how much of the page they will see. There are also an increasing number of handheld devices (mobile phones and tablets) that have smaller screens.
