# 19. A Liquid Layout

The liquid layout uses **`percentages`** to specify the width of each box so that the design will stretch to ﬁt the size of the screen. When trying this in your browser, remember to make the window smaller and larger.

There is a rule on the **`<body>`** element to set the width of the page to 90% so that there is a small gap between the left and right-hand sides of the browser window and the main content.

This is where the **`min-width`** and **`max-width`** properties help create boundaries within which the layout can stretch (although Internet Explorer 7 was the ﬁrst version of IE to support these properties).
