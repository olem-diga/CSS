# 21. CSS Frameworks

CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.
## Advantages

- They save you from repeatedly writing code for the same tasks.
- They will have been tested across diﬀerent browser versions (which helps avoid browser bugs).
## Disadvantages

- They often require that you use class names in your HTML code that only control the presentation of the page (rather than describe its content).
- In order to satisfy a wide variety of needs, they often contain more code than you need for your particular web page (commonly referred to as code “*bloat*”).
