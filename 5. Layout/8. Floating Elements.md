# 8. Floating Elements

**`float`**
The **`float`** property allows you to take an element in normal ﬂow and place it as far to the **left** or **right** of the containing element as possible.

Anything else that sits inside the containing element will *ﬂow* around the element that is ﬂoated.

When you use the **`float`** property, you should also use the **`width`** property to indicate how wide the ﬂoated element should be. If you do not, results can be inconsistent but the box is likely to take up the full width of the containing element (just like it would in normal ﬂow).
