# 16. Fixed Width Layouts

Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in **pixels**.
## Advantages

- Pixel values are accurate at controlling size and positioning of elements.
- The designer has far greater control over the appearance and position of items on the page than with liquid layouts.
- You can control the lengths of lines of text regardless of the size of the user's window.
- The size of an image will always remain the same relative to the rest of the page.
## Disadvantages

- You can end up with big gaps around the edge of a page.
- If the user's screen is a much higher resolution than the designer's screen, the page can look smaller and text can be harder to read.
- If a user increases font sizes, text might not Ô¨Åt into the allotted spaces.
- The design works best on devices that have a site or resolution similar to that of desktop or laptop computers.
- The page will often take up more vertical space than a liquid layout with the same content.
