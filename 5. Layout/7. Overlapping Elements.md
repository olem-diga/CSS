# 7. Overlapping Elements

**`z-index`**
When you use **`relative`**, **`ﬁxed`**, or **`absolute`** positioning, boxes can overlap. If boxes do overlap, the elements that appear later in the HTML code sit on top of those that are earlier in the page.

If you want to control which element sits on top, you can use the **`z-index`** property. Its value is a number, and the higher the number the closer that element is to the front. For example, an element with a **`z-index`** of **`10`** will appear over the top of one with a **`z-index`** of **`5`**.

The z-index is sometimes referred to as the **stacking context** (as if the blocks have been stacked on top of each other on a *z axis*). If you are familiar with desktop publishing packages, it is the equivalent of using the ‘bring to front’ and ‘send to back’ features.
